# Assembly examples

These are x86 Assembly language exercises I did while in college. Examples work with [Microsoft MASM](http://www.kipirvine.com/asm/gettingStartedVS2012/index.htm). Book used in class was [Assembly Language for x86 Processors (6th Edition)](http://kipirvine.com/asm/index6th.htm) by [Kip Irvine](http://kipirvine.com/).
